# Explanations
---------------
## IAM Users and Groups:
* IAM = Identity and Access Management (Global service)
* `Root account` create by default, shouldn't be shared
* Multiple `users` within your organization can be grouped togather
* `Groups` can container only `users` not other `groups`
* One `user` can also be part of multiple `groups`

## IAM Permissions:
* `Users and Groups` can be assigned with JSON document called `Policies`
* You don't want to be a programmer to write or understand the Policies, its just written in plain simple english.
* It basically helps to define what the users or group allowed to do.
* Example: ![alt text](../../content-images/image_10.png)
* Will look in detail about `Policy` in detail in next topic.

## Best Practises
* Makesure users are always part of `group` - don't let user alone without part of group
* Don't give more permissions than the user need (always follow `least privilage principle`)

----------
## User creation (with console login)
* On the Console Home page, select the `IAM service`
* In the navigation pane, select Users and then select Create user
* If user required console access, select `Provide user access to the AWS Management Console`
* Select `I want to create an IAM user`
* For Console password, select one of the following:
  Autogenerated password – The user gets a randomly generated password that meets the account password policy.
  Custom password – The user is assigned the password that you enter in the box.
* Makesure - `Users must create a new password at next sign-in - Recommended`
  
## Group creation
* If you already have group created click on `Add user to group`
* If not click on `create group`
* While creating the group - you should also be able to attch `Attach policies` on the group level.

## Tags
* Add any tags to the created `user` if required.

## How to login with created user
* Once user created, you can find `console sign-in url` with username & password which also can be downloaded in .csv file
* You can also `Email` the signin instructions.

## User creation (without console access)
* On the Console Home page, select the `IAM service`
* In the navigation pane, select Users and then select Create user
* Attach required group - if not exist create one
* Attach required policies to group

## Cleanup
* Navigate to `user` section click `Delete` and provide the username to confirm deletion.
* Navigate to `group` section click `Delete` and provide the group name to confirm deletion.
