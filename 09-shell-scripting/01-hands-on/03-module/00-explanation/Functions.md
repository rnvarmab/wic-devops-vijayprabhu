# Funtions

- We will discuss in detail about the shell functions
- Functions enable you to break down the overall functionality of a script into smaller, logical subsections, which can then be called upon to perform their individual tasks when needed
- Using functions to perform repetitive tasks is an excellent way to create code reuse

# Syntax

```
function_name () {
   list of commands
}
```

# Returning values from function

If incase you want to return any value from fucntion, you can use return along with it

# Syntax

```
return code
```

# Nested Functions

- Calling one function from another is called nested functions
