# Arithmetic operators

| Example           | Description                                          |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| expr 1 + 3        | `expr` can be used to calculate arithmetic operators |
| expr 2 - 1        |                                                      |
| expr 10 / 2       |                                                      |
| expr 20 % 3       |                                                      |
| expr 10 * 3       |                                                      |
| echo `expr 6 + 3` | you can also use echo to print expressions           |

# Mathematical operators

| Traditional method | Shell method | Meaning                       |
| ------------------ | ------------ | ----------------------------- |
| 5 == 6             | -eq          | is equal to                   |
| 5 != 6             | -ne          | is not equal to               |
| 5 < 6              | -lt          | is less than                  |
| 5 <= 6             | -le          | is less than or equal to      |
| 5 -gt 6            | -gt          | is greater than 5 > 6 if test |
| 5 >= 6             | -ge          | is greater than or equal to   |
