# Ansible configuration file :

- The latest `ansible.cfg` file should be present in `/etc/ansible`

- This file is more like an `settings` file for ansible

- You can get also check `ansible-config version` by using command `ansible-config â€“version`

- Major things to notice in configuration file is inventory file mapping `inventory  = /etc/ansible/*`

- This file can be modified as per our requirement
